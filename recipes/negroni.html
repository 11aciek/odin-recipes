	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Negroni Sbagliato is an elegant and refreshing variation on the classic Negroni, which has gained popularity due to its unique flavor and unusual origin story. "Sbagliato" means "mistake" in Italian, and the drink was created by accident when a bartender used prosecco instead of gin. This "mistake" turned out to be a hit, resulting in a cocktail with a lighter and more effervescent character.</p>
	<p>Negroni Sbagliato retains the distinctive bitter note thanks to Campari, which gives the drink an intense, herbal flavor with hints of orange and herbs. Sweet vermouth adds a subtle sweetness and depth, balancing the bitterness of Campari and providing a smooth finish. The prosecco brings bubbles and freshness, brightening and refreshing the cocktail, making Negroni Sbagliato a lighter and more vibrant drink compared to its classic counterpart.</p>
